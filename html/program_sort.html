        After placing the selected number of blocks of each program type on site, a simulation shuffles and rearranges them until requirements are met for adjacency. Each use space seeks out neighbors according to rules set by the user. These rules include allowed adjacency, as well as a quota of neighbors of each type to ensure that each space has equal access to what the building provides. This creates a collection of micro-cluster communities within the unified whole of the building.
